    "I decide to go scout out the park.  Being too careful is not a thing in my book."
    think_neet "Proper preparations are the key to staying safe in any shady dealings.  Porn, prostitution, drugs, and so on.  Having no plan for unexpected circumstances is a very easy way to get yourself killed."
    neet "Nothing out of the ordinary so far."
    think_neet "I look around at the traffic lights, quickly learning their timings.  The pattern used seems familiar to one the used around 2 monthes ago."
    think_neet "The space doesn't seem to crowded, and the cameras in the park seem to functioning properly.  This soothes my mind a bit, removing some of the worry I'm having about to today's drop."
    think_neet "Most people don't want to meet around cameras, due to the nature of the meeting they would be attending.  Doesn't matter much to me, as the cameras rarely are looking for people trading disks for cash.  Mostly looking for assaults and drug deals, with all the gangs around here."
    neet "Guess I'll just sit here and enjoy the scenery until my meeting."
    think_neet "I walk over to a park bench and take a seat, setting my briefcase down in between my legs."
    think_neet "Looking around, I see a few people jogging, obviously out for their morning runs."
    neet "How lucky..."
    think_neet "Its been 21 some odd years since I was born, and I still really haven't figured out what to do with myself.  Nothing worthwhile comes to mind when I think about it after all."
    think_neet "Being somewhat jealous of people who know what they want leads to odd conversations.  People like to go on about their dreams and how they can't wait until their able to go through with them."
    think_neet "I usually end up sitting there with a blank look on my face, as I have no idea what having a dream feels like.  I tend to drift through the days, making sure I can survive the next."
    think_neet "I waste away the rest of my time coming up with back up plans for later tonight."
